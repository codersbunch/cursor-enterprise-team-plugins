code-quality-standards:

- Functions must not exceed 50 lines - extract helpers if longer
- Files must not exceed 300 lines - split into modules if larger
- Cyclomatic complexity must not exceed 10 per function
- No TODO/FIXME comments older than 30 days without an associated ticket
- No duplicate code blocks longer than 10 lines - extract to shared utility
- Magic numbers must be named constants with descriptive names
- Deeply nested code (more than 3 levels) must be refactored using early returns
- Dead code (unreachable, unused exports) must be removed before merging
- No commented-out code in committed files - use git history instead
