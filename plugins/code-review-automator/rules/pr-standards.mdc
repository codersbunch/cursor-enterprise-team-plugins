description: Pull request standards for consistent, reviewable, and well-documented code changes
alwaysApply: true

pr-standards:

- PR titles must follow Conventional Commits format: feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, chore:
- Every PR must reference a ticket number in the description (e.g., Closes #123, Fixes JIRA-456)
- PRs must include a description of what changed, why, and how to test
- Keep PRs small and focused - one logical change per PR (aim for under 400 lines changed)
- Add screenshots or recordings for any UI changes
- Mark PRs as Draft until ready for review - never request review on incomplete work
- Respond to all review comments before merging - never leave unresolved threads
- Squash commits before merging to keep main branch history clean
- Delete feature branches after merging
